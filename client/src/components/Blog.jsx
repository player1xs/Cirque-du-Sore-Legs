            <h5>Trail Ultra (Tenerife), by Benedict Norton</h5>
            <img className="blog-pic" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/djgaevw62/image/upload/v1705917274/unnamed_2_x8xh1c.jpg" />

            If you have read my post on running the Spartan Trail races in the UK, you may remember me
            mentioning the three distances which can be run to complete the Trailfecta.
            The only way to complete this in Europe this year (2022) was to run the Ultra Trail in North Tenerife
            in &quot;Caserios de Anaga&quot;
            To say this race was brutal would be an understatement...</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            The race was set up by a local man who knows the hills better than most people claim to know the
            back of their hand.
            As far as I know, most parts of the run were some of his favourite daily running spots.
            The Ultra event covered a staggering 55km (5km bonus due to an environmental issue in one of the
            municipalities), and a mind blowing 4600m elevation gain; that would be a little more than half way
            up Everest, in case you were wondering.
            I arrived in Punta del Hidalgo the day before to pick up the bib and attend the mandatory briefing.
            Here Jose, the local man, and the Race Director introduced the race and gave some pointers on what
            to expect at which point of the race.
            Luckily someone from the Spartan management team spoke enough English to translate this
            information for me.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            I prepped my kit, did my last-minute checks, and grabbed an early night sleep.
            The weather predicted light clouds and somewhere betten 10-16C throughout the day. But I found
            that to be a lie.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            Start time to set off was 6am, with preliminary checks for the mandatory kit. Which were headlamp,
            flashing red rear light, thermal blanket and a minimum water bladder of 1L.
            Then we all gathered in the starting pen, got a few extra announcements, non of which I understood
            (all in spanish). They introduced special ambassadors for the trail race (different to the Spanish
            Spartan OCR ambassadors); These inlcuded a 2nd place winner of the Mont Blanc Ultra Marathon,
            and SkyRace Trail world champion.
            A few more comments, and then we set off in the dark by the coast, at sea level.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            A few short minutes in and everyone is setting their pace. My goodness, there are some fast chaps
            out there. But, in this scenario you are racing yourself, and you must plan the next few hours ahead.
            Head down and off I go. Not even 1km in and we are running uphill out of Punta del Hidalgo. We
            leave the town and it just keeps going up, snaking a hill for some time, and then running what I think
            was a valley while still climbing.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            Looking around, you could see a line of flashing lights up ahead and a sea of white head torches
            behind. Within 2km the field is stretched out long, longer than any Spartan race I have seen at this
            point in the game. We continue to climb a hill out in the open and heavy rainfall sets in. Visibility was
            down to 2m in front of you, as the torch from my headlamp reflecting of the heavy rain was near
            blinding.
            This didn’t stop the leaders, so it didn’t stop me.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            One and half hours of climbing a singletrack trail, on rather technical terrain, seemed to never end. I
            looked to my side, and although visibility was near zero, I did notice that there was a rather sheer
            drop, one miss-step and I would plummet a few hundred metres towards severe injury or death.
            But..hey-ho on we go. We climb some more and hit the first aid station, at this point I am feeling
            fresh and peachy. The rain was refreshing and kept me from overheating. The Spanish runners
            complained about the rain, as a Brit I ran in my natural element.
            The trail leveled out and up comes our first descent, which I remember from the briefing was
            technical (but I missed the part that it was the second descent, which I would later find out). The
            descent was somewhat steep, but easily something I am used to from Scottish mountains. So, I
            heeled it down with quite some speed and ran past several people in the process. The climb took
            almost 2hrs hours, but the descent only 17minutes. Which you could not revel in as we started the
            next climb.
            At this point the rain let off, and it was light out and the climb snaked from one hill to the next, but
            always gradually up.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            Time for the second main descent, and wow, this is where the briefing notes made sense.
            I arrive at a cliff top where fully geared mountaineers warn you to slow down and repeat the word
            technical over and over again.
            To put it simply, you are at the top of a hill, the trail stopped behind you, the next checkpoint is
            down a mountain side, not too far in distance horizontally, but vertical, wow. Again, a wrong step
            and you are definitely falling to your death, hitting several rocks and cacti along the way. Some parts
            had ropes the mountaineers put in place. But, mostly you jumped down bodyheight rocks and
            landing on uneven surfaces. An odd amount of time was spent on my bum here.
            Made it off the cliff, follow a road into Tegueste town, with the second check point/aid station.
            Orange slices, snack bars, chocolate spread sandwiches, and drinks; all a welcome sight.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            Run out the village, along the side of the mountain and gradually climbing again. You see some nice
            views of the village, and the valley it sits in, with some coastal shoreline too.
            We hit a rural street which never seemed to end, leading in a gorgeous forest that was near magical.
            Climb and climb some more, some drizzle/ fog set in. Which I found out at this point; we were
            actually in the clouds. Up, down, and running around the forest and the hills, I had several moments
            to revel in the surroundings. Although I was racing, the sound of the light rain and the beautiful surroundings made for a rather peaceful run and setting which calmed my mind a little, and was
            pure joy.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            The miles dragged on and I hit a couple more aid stations, down and up again, and we opened into a
            razor trail a top a mountain. We are around kilometre 26-28 at this point, and we are beginning yet
            another long descent. Let’s call it technical, and it snakes around. Wasn&#39;t too hard; however at this
            point running descents aggressively has inflamed something in my knee a little. Out of all the racers,
            I was maybe 1 of 4 who didn’t use running sticks. Which meant the impact on my joints was
            immense. So, I slowed down, a smidge, to conserve my power.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            We get out into the open and follow a road for a bit. The rain stopped and the sun started to peer
            through the clouds.
            Just as we ran down a hill, we certainly had to run up it again, following a rather steep road I just
            mentioned.
            We climb and enter a village where an aid station awaited us. This time, with some salty and savoury
            options. Because, who doesn’t want chorizo and olives while running. Filled up my two water flasks,
            scoffed some more orange slices, and off I went with some other runners.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            We jumped down a valley and followed a cute trail ducking in out and out of small housed areas.
            Here is where the struggle really started for me. With the amount of rain set, and the sun coming
            out; the air was chewable with humidity. It was warm and stuffy, and I struggled to get any air into
            my lungs. But I had to power on. Any uphill I walked, and even the shortest of flat sections, even 5-
            10m I jogged.
            At four different sections the volunteers told me there were only 15km left to run; 3km later, and
            still 15km left to run.
            I hit an aid station, which they told me was the last one and it was only downhill from here. Yet
            another lie. We were about to hit another climb, which I can only describe as the stairs from hell.
            Still struggling to breathe, I had a stop several times to try and catch it. A mix of man and natural
            stairs, which often came at an uncomfortable height. You look up and see only more steps, and a
            glimmer of ‘maybe it stops soon’ (I think I was hallucinating at this point). We come into a village, I
            scouted the trails/ roads left and right for the next section….instead we climbed more of the stairs.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            After being promised (before the stairs) it was all downhill, up came another climb. But, judging by
            the position of the sun, we were heading towards the finish line.
            This climb was steady but enjoyable. Once we hit the top, you could see the stunning Ocean, where
            bright turquoise waves hit the shore. Starting the last descent, my injuries did impair me a little.
            Downhill trail was somewhat enjoyable but steady, passing afternoon hikers with what can only be
            described as a grim smile.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            Angels welcomed me at the last aid station of the day (although I was told I hit the last, last time).
            This was a welcome sight; as the stairway from hell emptied my remaining last 1L of liquid,
            and snacks.
            Then continuing a brief down-stint on cement blocks into the town, I kind of had to serpentine. I did
            add extra milage, but making my knee injury less painful did help. Then I remembered the
            race briefing; where we were told that that are another 3-4km along the coast instead of
            going straight to the finish. So entering the town was fine, eventually hitting the shoreline,
            which then looped out a bit. Although we were running along the coast, the blistering
            afternoon 2pm sun hit us.
            We did get a warning for this. The winds from the shore did help, but that afternoon sun did burn;
            with no shade to escape in.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            After a few turns, buildings came into sight. I got my last wind of the day. Before you know it 2km
            flew by, and I entered the last stretch. I can hear music. Swing around the last couple
            corners and I entered that sweet sweet length of finish-line alley. I made friends with the
            Spanish Spartan hypeman the day before. He saw me slinging the corner, turned down the
            music and with a thunderous cheer exclaimed “all the way from London, here comes mister
            England”, and for the first time ever of me crossing a finish line, the crowd went WILD.
            I held up my bib number and crossed the line. Suddenly all the adrenaline that was flowing through
            my body for the last 20km rushed to my face. I broke down in tears, and I started
            hyperventilating. I crossed the line at 9hrs 16min. My first goal was sub 12hrs. My optimistic
            goal was sub 9hrs. Given that I walked close to 10km downhill, my optimistic goal was well in
            reach, if it weren’t for injury. Pretty sure I could have hit 8.
            I got my well-deserved medal, water, and hot finish-line food plate. Then I sat there on my
            lonesome, revelling in the accomplishment of what I had just achieved, planning to head
            back to my hotel to get cleaned up and chill in the pool….but while at the finish line; several
            Spanish runners, whom I never met, came up to me and congratulate me. People who didn’t
            speak a word of English, and myself not able to speak Spanish…but we connected through
            our achievement.</p>
            <p className="blog-tag">
            First place finished after 6hrs 30, and the last person to finish was around 12hrs. There were around
            30 people taken off course for being too slow.
            I loved this race and will attend another time. Maybe next time with a team from the UK, and not
            just solo. Do inform me if interested…Show them European runners what we are made of.
            SPARTAN UK for the win! AROO
